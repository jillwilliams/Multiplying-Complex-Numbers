        Multiplying Complex Numbers
    </h1>
    <h2>
        In the last unit, we learned to simplify complex numbers by combining like terms. We learned variable "i" can be temporarily replaced by "x" to make the solution easier for you. 
        <br><br>
        Now that you've had some experience adding and subtracting complex numbers, next we will multiply complex numbers.
    </h2>
    <p>
        To multiply complex numbers you use the Distributive Property or FOIL. While it is still okay to replace "i" with "x" during the Foil-ing, I would not recommend this. It will cause us to get the wrong answer because something tricky happens.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's go back and talk about the definition of "i" for a minute. √-1 = i. If we squared both sides of the equation, the value i<sup>2</sup> = -1.  This is the tricky term that we will need to keep an eye out for when we are using FOIL to multiply the two binomials. 
    </p>
    <p>
        FOIL works the same way as always. <br><br>
        Multiplying (5 + 3x)(4 - 2x) is no different then multiplying (5 + 3i)(4 - 2i). Just keep an eye out for any i<sup>2</sup> terms in which we will use substitution since i<sup>2</sup> = -1. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Leaving i<sup>2</sup> in the answer will get marked as incorrect. Because i<sup>2</sup> can be simplified by substituting -1, you must do this step to get the correct answer. Don't forget the tricky term!
